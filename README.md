Who Is A Blockchain Developer
-----------------------------

A blockchain developer has the knowledge and skill-set to develop and optimize decentralized applications or dApps and smart contracts based on blockchain as well as blockchain architecture and protocols. They also deal with 3D modeling, 3D design, 3D content development such as that happens in game development.

The developers have certain specializations based on skills and interests and according to the nature of work.

### Types Of Blockchain Developers

**#1) Core blockchain developers**

These are responsible for developing and optimizing architecture. The developer will design, develop, and optimize the protocols that support a blockchain solution. A good example is the consensus protocol which defines how and the ways in which members using the blockchain and the resources therein agree on sharing and using these resources.

*   They also make decisions relating to such.
*   They implement the functionality and features of the blockchain and ensure that they work as intended.
*   They design and implement the security of the network.
*   They ensure the network is operational.
*   They plan, design, and implement integrations of the blockchain network with other services.
*   They plan on extending the features and functionality of a blockchain network.

**#2) Blockchain software developers**

They develop and implement the design as per the plan by the core developer.

*   They develop dApps.
*   They implement smart contracts as per design by core developers.
*   They ensure dApps run as planned.
*   The research on and look after integration of the blockchain network with other services and apps.

**Other categorizations**

**#3) Back-end developers**

These can design and develop APIs, carry-on performance tests, do blockchain deployment, design software specifications, work alongside other developers to develop software, and provide technical support.

**#4) Smart contract engineers**

They audit and develop smart contracts, meet with users and buyers, understand business flows and security to ensure no flaws in smart contracts, and study smart contracts, do end-to-end testing of the business processes.

### Why Become A Blockchain Developer

**The following reasons will explain it better:**

**#1) High demand** 

**Cutting edge technology and potential for growth:** Prospects are very high for blockchain with 84% of companies dabbling in blockchain-based on the last year’s PwC survey. Many more people will use blockchain. Just less than 1% of companies have implemented the technology, with many more looking at the possibility of implementing in the future.

**#2) Amazing pay**
Blockchain developer salary is huge and they make [between $150,000 and $175,000](https://devskiller.com/blockchain-developer-salary/) on average per year in the United States. According to this report, a developer’s salary is one of the highest salaries paid in the industry. More pay applies to the experienced and highly skilled in the blockchain.

**#3) Ability to teach others**
Blockchain developer jobs and training can open more revenue streams by teaching others the skills to develop on the same. **For instance,** they can teach via online tutorial platforms.

**#4)** They get to **understand crypto, ICOs, etc,** and how they and their companies can raise capital using new revenue streams with crypto.

**#5) Improved digital identity and security**
Blockchain offers better promise for organizations wishing to secure their operations and platforms more than would help the legacy non-blockchain platforms.

Blockchain platforms and processes such as digital identities also help cut down the process and operational costs for developers and their organizations.

**#6) Contribute to other new-age technologies**
Blockchain integrates with other technologies such as IoT.

### How To Become A Certified Blockchain Developer Or Engineer

**#1) Understand the blockchain basics.** Either learn on your own or join a course in an institution or online tutorial platform.

Learn blockchain including decentralization, consensus mechanisms, hashing functions, mining, security, and cryptocurrencies, as well as the blockchain development tools. Learn blockchain components such as blocks, block index, timestamp, block hash, block time, etc.

**#2) Learn hands-on and interact with the system**
Download and use already developed wallets or dApps and learn how they work. Create or generate and use wallet addresses and private keys, transfer value such as crypto over two or more blockchain, learn the data recording and transactions, understand and interact with exchange and smart contract platforms, join developer forums and interact with developers.

**#3) Get coding and earn certification.** Either join a coding school or course at an institution or university or learn on your own, **for instance,** through online paid and free courses.

You can start learning to code from scratch or advance your coding career to specialize in the blockchain.

Learn the coding languages such as C++ and Javascript and how they are applied in blockchain coding, learn to code that helps with blockchain resource management, learn to select the right coding languages that optimize blockchain performance, learn the deterministic (isolation) nature of transactions in blockchains and how to achieve this in code, and learn to code all aspects of blockchain.

You must also learn to do code analysis.

**#4) Become a blockchain engineer** either on your own or as part of the hackathon, competition, or at a blockchain training institution and earn certification. Develop a blockchain by developing a genesis block and adding other blocks, validate the chain, and use the blockchain.

**#5) Learn and develop a smart contract, earn certification, and use it**
Learn the deterministic, terminable, and isolated nature of smart contracts, and develop them.

**#6) Join a blockchain developer practice, hackathon, or company internship.**

**#7) Look for a job and work as a blockchain developer or engineer**
To achieve the above steps each at a time, you might take many courses that offer the different relevant certifications separately. These can be taken incrementally step by step, either at a single institution or at different institutions. Alternatively, you can undertake a single course that teaches all the skills to earn a single certification.

### Technical Skills Required For Blockchain Developers

**#1) Understand Blockchain architecture**
Ensure to understand [what is blockchain](https://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/blockchain-tutorial/), and advanced blockchain security, blockchain application, blockchain integration, and blockchain advantages and limitations as well as challenges. Blockchain developers need to understand blockchain consensus, hash functions, and distributed ledger technology. The white-paper defines the architecture and working of blockchain.

There is a need to understand different blockchains and their working – Ethereum, Bitcoin, Neo, and Hyperledger being the most important ones.

**#2) Data structures and databases**
The developer must configure the blockchain network appropriately as per requirement and therefore must understand the various and thus the best database and data structures for the target network.

**#3) Smart contract development**
Let’s say the understanding of smart contract platforms and how best to apply them. The developer should understand the types of smart contracts and how to develop them.

**#4) Understand decentralization as applied in blockchain and decentralized applications**
These dApps can be built on different blockchain platforms using different protocols and procedures.

**#5) Understanding of cryptography**
Cryptography and digital ledger are the basis of blockchain workings. The developer should understand what cryptography is, the algorithms that apply in cryptography, and which algorithms work best for what types of blockchain networks. They must know how these algorithms are developed.

**#6) Understand Cryptonomics**
This is the economics ideas in cryptocurrencies and how this is coded on the blockchain. The blockchain developer training and courses may teach game theory, mathematical frameworks for modeling Cryptonomics, and the conflicts involved in modeling. Trainees may also be taught factors that affect Cryptonomics and related monetary policies.

**#7) Computer coding**
Computer programming is essential for the development of any advanced and effective decentralized apps or dApps although in some cases you might be able to develop beginner dApps without this skill.

**Here is a video on Computer Coding:**
Most blockchain developers start by learning a programming language or coding then use that to specialize in blockchain development. Most blockchain development requires mainstream programming or coding languages but some blockchains like Ehereum require knowledge in a specific coding language they are based on to develop anything on them.

Languages in which you need the expertise to develop for blockchain are C++, C#, Java, Python, Simplicity, Solidity. Advanced development on blockchain may require more than one coding language.

The top blockchain platforms on which to target as a blockchain developer are Bitcoin, Ethereum, Hyperledger, Ripple, Spark Solidity, Stellar, Neo, and EOS.
